# Solving-a-System-of-First-Order-ODEs-using-Numerical-Methods
This file contains python codes for Solving Systems of First Order ODEs using Numerical Methods. 

The codes consist of the implementation of the 

1. Euler's Method,

2. Runge Kutta 2nd Order Method (i.e. Heun's, Midpoint, Ralston's Method),

3. Runge Kutta 3rd Order Method, and

4. Runge Kutta 4th Order Method.
