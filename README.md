# Solving-a-System-of-First-Order-ODEs-using-Numerical-Methods
This file contains python codes for solving systems of first order ODEs. It consist of the implementation of the Euler's Method, Runge Kutta 2nd Order Method (i.e. Heun's, Midpoint, Ralston's Method), Runge Kutta 3rd Order Method and Runge Kutta 4th Order Method.
